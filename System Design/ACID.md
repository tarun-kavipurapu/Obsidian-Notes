### Atomicity
Either the The operation Should happen Completely or it should not there shouldn't be anything in between to ensure that we can nicely wrap the operations in a Transaction
	My Own Experience
	 1. When i Was creating the signup Endpoint I had Take User address as an Input and also User Details as an Input
    2. In the Database I had address table separately and the users table separately I had to enter details into both of them atomically So I wrapped both of them in a transaction and executed it.


### Consistency
- When I have a Foreign key in the Table Corresponding Information Should be present in the other table where the primary key is this key.
- If i have 100 dollars i should not be able to transfer 200 dollars

No matter what happens my database moves from one consistent state to other consistent state
Ex:
Lear about `constraints` `cascades` `triggers`
`CASCADES`:
	1. For example i have a parent table `user` and i have an `address` table as child so if i delete `user` table the `address` table will become orphan so what will `cascades` do is that they will also remove all address related to that particular user
	2. Parent row delete all the child tables also delete
`Trigger`:
		1. On certain operation trigger something
### Isolation Levels

	

### Durability

No matter what happens so long as disc is there data should be there.
the changes should outlive the outage.
