A **distributed system** is a network of independent computers or nodes that work together to achieve a common goal. In a distributed system, the components communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. These systems are designed to share resources, balance workloads, and provide high availability and fault tolerance. The key characteristics of distributed systems include:

- **Concurrency**: Multiple processes or tasks are executed simultaneously across the nodes.
- **Scalability**: The system can expand or contract to accommodate varying loads.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system can continue to operate even if some of the nodes fail.
- **Transparency**: Users perceive the distributed system as a single coherent system, even though it is composed of multiple distinct components.

Examples of distributed systems include cloud computing platforms, peer-to-peer networks, and large-scale web services.
