Title: 086 Intro to Back End Architecture MVC Types of Logic and More

- This lecture provides an introduction to back-end architecture, specifically focusing on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
- MVC is a widely used and well-known architecture that helps in designing code structure and organization.
- There are different ways to implement MVC, but the lecture focuses on a straightforward approach.
- The MVC architecture consists of three main components: Model, View, and Controller.
- The Model layer handles the application's data and business logic.
- The Controller layer is responsible for handling requests, interacting with models, and sending responses back to the client. It encompasses the application logic.
- The View layer is necessary when dealing with a graphical interface or server-side rendered websites. It comprises templates used to generate the view presented to the client.
- The MVC architecture allows for a more modular and maintainable application, making it easier to scale as needed.
- In the context of the application's request-response cycle, a request first hits a router, which delegates it to the appropriate controller.
- Controllers interact with models to retrieve or manipulate data before sending a response back to the client.
- In cases where a website needs to be rendered, the controller selects a view template, injects data into it, and sends the rendered website as the response.
- The separation of business logic and application logic is a key goal of MVC.
- Application logic focuses on the implementation details of the application and manages requests and responses.
- Business logic, on the other hand, directly solves the underlying business problem, addressing specific business rules and needs.
- Examples of business logic in the context of the application discussed include creating new tours, validating user input data, and enforcing business rules.
- While application logic and business logic overlap to some extent, best practices recommend keeping them separate.
- The philosophy of "fat models, thin controllers" suggests offloading as much logic as possible into models and keeping controllers focused on request and response management.
