lscpu revealed an Physical and virtual address of

```JavaScript
Address sizes:         39 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
```

Let us Investigate what is physical and virtual address

The statement "Address sizes: 39 bits physical, 48 bits virtual" refers to the sizes of physical and virtual memory addresses used by a computer system.

Physical Address:

- A physical address is the actual address in the main memory (RAM) where data is stored.
- In this case, it mentions that the physical address size is 39 bits.
- With 39 bits, the maximum physical memory that can be addressed is 2^39 = 512 gigabytes (GB).

Virtual Address:

- A virtual address is an address used by a process or program to access memory.
- The virtual address is mapped to a physical address by the memory management unit (MMU) of the computer system.
- In this case, it mentions that the virtual address size is 48 bits.
- With 48 bits, the maximum virtual memory that can be addressed is 2^48 = 256 terabytes (TB)

So My next Series of Questions were?

1. Does that mean my cpu can support 512GB of RAM (Physical address space)
2. How exactly is Virtual Memory working?

Q1)Does that mean my cpu can support 512GB of RAM (Physical address space)

Yes, that's correct. The 39-bit physical address size mentioned in the `lscpu` output means that your CPU can theoretically support and directly address up to 512GB of physical RAM.

However, it's important to note that the maximum amount of RAM that can be installed and utilized effectively also depends on other factors, such as:

1. Motherboard and chipset specifications: The motherboard and chipset must support and be designed for that amount of RAM.
2. Operating system limitations:  
    Some operating systems may have limitations on the maximum amount of RAM they can utilize, even if the CPU and motherboard support more.  
    
3. Cost and availability:  
    Installing 512GB of RAM would be extremely expensive and may not be  
    readily available or practical for most use cases.  
    
4. Power consumption and cooling  
    requirements: Supporting that much RAM would also require significant  
    power and cooling capabilities from the system.  
    

So, while your CPU has the capability to directly address up to 512GB of RAM with its 39-bit physical address size, whether you can actually install and effectively utilize that much RAM depends on the other components and specifications of your specific system configuration.

In most consumer and general-purpose systems, the amount of RAM installed is typically much lower, such as 8GB, 16GB, or 32GB, as that is usually sufficient for most workloads and provides a better balance between cost and performance.

Q2)How exactly is Virtual Memory working?(Further investigation required)

Virtual memory is a technique that allows a computer system to use more memory than is physically available by temporarily transferring data between RAM (physical memory) and storage (usually a hard disk or solid-state drive). Here's how it works:

1. **Virtual Address Space**: Each process is assigned a virtual address space, which is a range of memory addresses that the process can use. This virtual address space is typically much larger than the available physical memory.
2. **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: The MMU is a hardware component in the CPU that translates virtual addresses used by processes into physical addresses in RAM.
3. **Paging**: The virtual memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages (e.g., 4KB). Physical memory is also divided into page frames of the same size.
4. **Page Table**: The operating system maintains a page table that maps the virtual memory pages of each process to physical page frames in RAM. If a process tries to access a virtual memory page that is not currently in RAM, a page fault occurs.
5. **Page Fault Handling**: When a page fault occurs, the operating system follows these steps:  
    a. It finds an unused page frame in RAM or selects a page frame to be swapped out to disk using a page replacement algorithm (e.g., Least Recently Used).  
    b. If a page frame needs to be swapped out, it writes the contents of that page frame to a swap file or swap partition on disk.  
    c. It reads the required page from the disk (if it was swapped out earlier) or allocates a new page from the swap file/partition.  
    d. It updates the page table to map the virtual page to the newly loaded physical page frame.  
    e. It resumes the execution of the process with the required page now in RAM.  
    
6. **Demand Paging**: Virtual memory allows for demand paging, where pages are loaded into RAM only when they are needed, rather than loading an entire process into memory at once.
7. **Thrashing**: If a system is overcommitted and doesn't have enough RAM to store all the pages needed by running processes, it can enter a state of thrashing, where it spends most of its time swapping pages between RAM and disk, leading to severe performance degradation.

By using virtual memory, the operating system can provide processes with a larger memory space than the available physical memory. However, accessing data from disk is much slower than accessing data from RAM, so there is a trade-off between the amount of memory available and performance.

Virtual memory allows more processes to run concurrently and makes it possible to run larger programs than would fit in physical memory alone, but it can also lead to performance issues if not managed properly.

Questions:

1. Can the Drama thats happening in swap file or disk be observed and does this happen differently according to operating sytem?
2. Revise Paging and Virtual Memory that we learnt in Operating System
